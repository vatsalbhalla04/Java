Some Important Info Regarding String And StringBuffer : 
1)In java the String is not a datatype it's an class .

2)In java String is an immutable class because : Immutability allows for optimizations like 
string pooling, which can improve performance.

3)String Pooling : String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals
are stored.It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool. 
It is just like object allocation. By default, it is empty and privately maintained by the Java String class. 

Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory.
Creating a number of strings may increase the cost and memory too which may reduce the performance also.

4)A StringBuffer is a class in Java used to create and manipulate mutable strings 
(i.e., strings that can be modified after they are created). 
Unlike the String class in Java, which creates immutable strings, 
StringBuffer allows you to perform operations like appending, inserting, 
replacing, or deleting characters without creating new objects.
